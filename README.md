# Testing

We are using selenium using java for testing. We have implemented three scenories for testing i.e login , register and home page. We are generating test reports using cucumber.

steps involved:

- Run on any scenario and then in the console we see a link to the test report which is available for 24hours.
- If we want our test reports forever we need to create a collection in the cucumber. we can find the link to it in the console itself.
- After creating collections in cucumber we have to add that cucumber token in cucumber.properities file, then everytime we run a scenario the report will be generted in the cucumber collections, which is available forever.
