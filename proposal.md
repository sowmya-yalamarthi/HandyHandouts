# Proposal for HAND-IN HAND-OUT
## Statement Of Purpose:
- Every university tend to hand out books to students based on their respective courses and intrests. If in case of books shortage or damaged books or other reasons the university tend to ask students to buy textbooks from other sources. After the year is done most of these books are either sold on other websites or students tend to recycle them. 
The project Handy HandOuts aims at developing a functional computerized system to maintain all the day-to-day activity of books in a library. This project has features such as the facility of user login, the ability to view books that are available. The main users of this project would be students.

 ## Overview:

 - Students can rent for books on certain price per day and for certain days based on the book that they select.
 
 ## Benefits:
